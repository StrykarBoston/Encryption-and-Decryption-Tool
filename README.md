# Encryption-and-Decryption-Tool
# Overview

This Python-based tool is a straightforward but powerful encryption and decryption tool. It makes use of 'Pycryptodome' for cryptographic operations and the 'Tkinter' library for the graphical user interface. You may safely encrypt and decode files and messages using this tool.

<br>

# Features

- Encrypt Files and Text Messages : Securely encrypt any file and Text Messages using Triple DES (3DES) encryption.
- Decrypt Files and Text Messages : Decrypt previously encrypted files and Text Messages .
- User-friendly GUI: Easy-to-use interface for selecting files and entering encryption keys.
